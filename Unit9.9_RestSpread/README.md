As the lead engineer 🧑‍🔬 in the Wildlife Oasis 🐘, you manage the sanctuary's database of endangered species using advanced JavaScript techniques.

Your tasks are:

1. **Track Animal Sightings**: Write a function with rest parameters to print sightings of different animals within the sanctuary. This function should accept an arbitrary number of animal names.
2. **Merge Habitat Areas**: You are given two arrays of habitat names. Use the spread operator to combine them into a comprehensive list of protected areas within the sanctuary.
3. **Update Conservation Status**: You are given an object representing an animal's conservation status. Use the spread operator to update this status with new information, such as an increase in population or a change in habitat.
4. **Catalog Genetic Diversity**: Duplicate an animal profile object using a shallow copy. Add genetic diversity information using the  property to this copy. Observe and explain how changes to nested properties affect both the original and the copied object.
5. **Analyze Ecosystem Health**: You are given an object with a nested structure detailing the ecosystem's health, including water quality and food supply. Perform a shallow copy and modify a nested property. Observe and explain how changes to nested properties affect both the original and the copied object.
